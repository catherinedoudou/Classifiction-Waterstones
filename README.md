# Classifiction-Waterstones
The main focus here was to classify a book by genre using machine learning  algorithms

## Stakeholder: The Leeds Library librarians
There are many books which are not classified by its genre which makes librarians and reader difficult to classify the book. 


### How?
To classify genre of this books, prediction of genres is made based on the book title and summaries. The goal is to 
create a model that can determine how representative a title is of its genre. And by the way, it is very difficult for even a human to distinguish between books of different categories. I will utilize three distinctive ML algorithms and discover contrast of one another's exactness and 
expectation yield to improve results

### DataSet
Furthermore, a dataset will be used which contains title, categories, its sort and dynamic. This dataset will be utilized to group and 
foresee the class of the book.. The motivation was to getting a proper genre categorized books collections 
which will make user easy to get classified books as per its genre requirement. And also, can be used in big 
books stores and libraries to organize books according to their requirement.
